Mutt-LDAP provides an `external address query script`_ for Mutt_ which
connects to LDAP_ databases using python-ldap_.  It can cache queries
locally in case your LDAP server is slow or not always available,
expiring cached queries after a configurable amount of time.

Usage
=====

  usage: mutt_ldap [-h] [--version] [--config CONFIG] [--verbose]
                  query [query ...]

positional arguments:
  query            Search query for the LDAP directory

optional arguments:
  --config CONFIG  Path to the configuration file

If the ``xdg`` module supplied by PyXDG_ is not available, the default
configuration path falls back on ``~/.config/mutt-ldap.cfg`` and the default
cache path falls back on ``~/.cache/mutt-ldap.json``.

To use in mutt, add the following line to your ``~/.muttrc``::

  set query_command = "mutt_ldap.py '%s'"

Search for addresses (from Mutt_) with ``^t``, optionally after typing
part of the name.  Configure your connection by creating
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt-ldap.cfg`` containing something like::

  [connection]
  server = myserver.example.net
  port   = 1389
  basedn = ou=people,dc=example,dc=net
  [auth]
  user         = username
  password-cmd = pass example

The query cache (enabled by default) will be created at
``$XDG_DATA_HOME/mutt-ldap.json``, unless overridden by an explicit
``cache.path`` setting.

See the `XDG Base Directory Specification`_ for more
details on configuration and cache file locations.  

Example Config File
===================

Create a file named ``mutt-ldap.cfg`` with the following content:

.. code:: ini

   [connection]
   server = domaincontroller.yourdomain.com
   port = 389
   ssl = no
   starttls = no
   basedn = ou=x co.,dc=example,dc=net

   [auth]
   user =
   password =
   file =
   gssapi = no

   [query]
   filter =
   search-fields = cn displayName uid mail

   [cache]
   enable = yes
   path =
   fields =
   longevity-days = 14

   [system]
   output-encoding =
   argv-encoding =

Config Settings
=================================

Connection Section
------------------

-  ``server``: The domain name or IP address of the LDAP server.
-  ``port``: The port number to connect to on the LDAP server. Use ``389`` for LDAP or ``636`` for LDAPS (LDAP over SSL).
-  ``ssl``: Set to ``yes`` to enable SSL encryption. If using SSL, ensure the port is set to ``636``.
-  ``starttls``: Set to ``yes`` to enable STARTTLS, which upgrades a plain text connection to an encrypted connection.
-  ``basedn``: The base DN (Distinguished Name) for LDAP queries.

Auth Section
------------

-  ``user``: The username for binding to the LDAP server. Leave blank for anonymous binding.
-  ``password``: The password for binding to the LDAP server. Leave blank if using anonymous or GSSAPI authentication.
-  ``file``: Path to a file containing credentials if not specified directly.
-  ``gssapi``: Set to ``yes`` to enable GSSAPI authentication.

Query Section
-------------

-  ``filter``: LDAP search filter to match entries. Leave blank to match all entries.
-  ``search-fields``: Space-separated list of fields to include in wildcard searches.

Cache Section
-------------

-  ``enable``: Set to ``yes`` to enable caching of query results.
-  ``path``: The directory path where cache files will be stored. If left blank, defaults to XDG standard cache location.
-  ``fields``: Specific fields to cache. If left blank, all fields from the main query block are cached.
-  ``longevity-days``: The number of days before cache entries are considered stale and invalidated.

System Section
--------------

-  ``output-encoding``: The character encoding for output. Should match the character set expected by the application consuming the LDAP query results.
-  ``argv-encoding``: The character encoding for command-line arguments. This is a workaround for Python 2.x systems.

Notes
-----


-  The ``system`` section includes workarounds for Python 2.x encoding issues. These settings should match the expected encodings used by the system and the application, respectively.
-  It is important to secure the ``auth`` section, especially if a username and password are provided, to prevent unauthorized access.
-  The ``cache`` section’s settings should be adjusted based on the frequency of changes in the LDAP directory and the application’s tolerance for stale data.
